# ios-dispatch-async-example
An example of using async-dispatch to perform two processes over an image in parallel.

Project code is most easily viewed by looking at files in vurb-take-home-mobile-exerceise. (Yeah typo there).

The main organization is:

CardCreator.swift creates a custom UIVIewTable made up of CardViewTableViewCell cells- each has an image and some information on it.

The main view controller then accesses the table view of the card creator and displays it.
